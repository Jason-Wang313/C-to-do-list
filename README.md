C-Based Command-Line To-Do List ManagerThis is a simple but fully-functional to-do list application that runs in the terminal. It is built entirely in C with no external libraries.This project was created to practice and demonstrate fundamental C programming concepts, especially those related to data structures, memory management, and file persistence.FeaturesAdd: Add new tasks to your list.List: View all current tasks with their status (complete/incomplete).Mark Complete: Mark a task as completed.Delete: Remove a task from the list.Save & Load: Your to-do list is automatically saved to tasks.txt when you quit and reloaded when you start the app, so your tasks are persistent.How to Compile & RunThis program is designed to be compiled with gcc on a standard Linux/macOS environment (or with MinGW/WSL on Windows).Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
cd [YourRepoName]
Compile the program:gcc todo.c -o todo
Run the executable:./todo
(On Windows, you might run todo.exe)Key C Concepts DemonstratedThis project was a practical exercise in the following C concepts, which are critical for systems-level programming:struct: Used to define the Task data type, which bundles the task's description, its completion status, and a pointer to the next task.Pointers (and Pointers-to-Pointers):struct Task *next was used to link tasks together.struct Task **head (a pointer-to-a-pointer) was passed to functions like addTask and deleteTask. This allows the function to modify the head pointer itself, which is essential for handling an empty list or deleting the first node.Dynamic Memory Allocation:malloc() is used to allocate memory for each new Task on the heap, allowing the list to grow to any size.free() is used to release memory when a task is deleted or when the program quits, preventing memory leaks.Singly Linked List: This data structure was implemented from scratch to store the tasks. It is more flexible than a static array, as it can easily grow and shrink.File I/O:fopen(), fclose(), fprintf(), and fgets() are used to implement persistence.The task list is saved to tasks.txt in a simple CSV format (completed,description) and parsed back into the linked list on startup.Safe User Input:fgets() and sscanf() are used to get user input instead of the less safe scanf(). This prevents buffer overflows and makes parsing more robust.
